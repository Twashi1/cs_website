        <p>
            Of all applications of computing, it is undeniable that Microsoft
            Powerpoint has had the largest beneficial impact on society. From
            school presentations, teaching, to professional meetings and the vast
            world of business, Microsoft Powerpoint has stretched its presence
            into every one of our lives, and changed it for the better. Without
            its stunning, elegant slides which concisely convey only ever the most
            important information, it is only obvious the world would be lagging
            10 years<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a>]</sup>
            behind its current advancement.

        <!-- All stolen from wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint  -->
        <p>
            Microsoft Powerpoint, despite the name, originated from a software company
            called Forethought Inc and was released in April 1987 for Macintosh computers.
            Just three months later, Microsoft acquired the program, acknowledging the
            immense potential of this revolutionary application. It took the common
            public longer to realise the true power of the app, thus PowerPoint initially
            had a miniscule market share, but grew rapidly with the booming success of
            Windows and Microsoft Office.
